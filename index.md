## Introduction

Vandalism is damage to public or private property. It has been a serious problem in San Francisco for a long time.
For example, graffiti on walls in the Mission District and broken windows in SOMA cost the city large sums of money each year.
They also reduce the sense of safety in local neighborhoods. Police data from 2003 to 2024 show that vandalism in San Francisco
may have changed with local policy shifts and community efforts.

In 2006, then-Mayor Gavin Newsom started the “Graffiti Watch” program [1]. It asked residents to report graffiti incidents
and restore damaged public spaces. In 2015, reports of serious vandalism such as broken car windows went up. Then,
law enforcement targeted repeat offenders [2][3]. But these actions were not the same across all areas. Some grassroots groups
and neighborhood coalitions also formed. They tried to involve young people and create mural projects that turned graffiti
into approved street art.

In 2018, the city introduced stricter rules. They required property owners to remove graffiti within 48 hours or pay fines [4].
Some people say this led to a quick rise in recorded vandalism because more cases were reported. Others believe large events and
more tech workers influenced these changes. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021–2022, certain kinds of vandalism went up in some districts [5].

These social and policy factors guide our data exploration. For this project, we use crime reports from 2003 to 2024 to answer key questions:

- When does vandalism happen most often (by hour, day, or season)?
- Where are the main hotspots, and how have they shifted over time?
- Did policy changes or community efforts affect vandalism rates?

## Conclusion

The analysis shows that vandalism in San Francisco depends on both time and place.
We see higher incidents on weekends and during evening hours. We also find hotspots that stay active for many years.
Some neighborhoods report high activity, but others show improvement over time.

These patterns can guide policymakers, law enforcement, and local communities on where and when to act.
They can add more surveillance, hold public awareness events, or improve street lighting.
This data makes it easier to build safer neighborhoods and meet community needs.
